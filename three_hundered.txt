My name is Omar Irshad and I am Senior Computer Engineering Student at the Texas A&M University with an expected graduation time of Spring 23’. I chose Computer Science as my emphasis track for my degree as I love the field and hope to get a full-time job in it one day. I currently live in between Houston and Galveston in a city called Friendswood TX. I have been blessed enough to have two different internship experiences in the past, one with Dow Chemical as an Electrical Engineering intern and one with Fujitsu as Software Engineering Intern. I enjoyed them both thoroughly and got to gain a lot valuable learning experience. 
To preface a little about myself, I come from a family of 5 and have two of the greatest brothers of all time. Fun fact, my older brother’s name is Omayr and my younger brothers name is Ammar. That makes us Omayr, Omar, and Ammar.
