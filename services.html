                <h1>Clear Lake Islamic Center</h1>
                <p>Clear Lake Islamic Center has been one of the most impactful parts of my life. Being my second home, I’ve been lucky enough to help out in the community whenever the opportunity arose. This includes setting up for events, cleaning, and volunteering for food drives. I’ve been helping out for the past 10 years have never regretted a moment of it.</p>

                <h1>Project Downtown</h1>
                <p>Project Downtown is service that I was introduced to by my roommate when I was a freshman at Texas A&M. It consists of helping out the locals in the Bryan and College Station area by transporting and giving back food from local distributors. I participated in this service during my freshman year.</p>
