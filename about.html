                <p>I’m currently a senior Computer Engineering student that attends <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. I was born and raised in Friendswood Texas, which is a small suburban city in between Houston and Galveston. I come from a family of five with two siblings, my best friends, being my older and younger brother. Fun fact, my older brother’s name is Omayr and my younger brothers name is Ammar. If you call us from oldest to youngest, it would be Omayr, Omar, Ammar. Studying Computer Engineering has been a rigorous journey for the past 4 years here at Texas A&M. However, I’m blessed with the opportunities and experiences that I’ve gained from it. I was able to get both an Electrical and Software engineering internship during my undergraduate time here. From them, I was able to gain an understanding of what I like and what I see myself doing in the future. Soon, I see myself becoming a Software Developer of some sort preferably working with the back end. I then hope to transition the technical knowledge and skills that I gain into management. Although school has been a big part of my life, something else has been the crux of my life. That would be my religion, Islam. The communities that I’m involved in, the friends I surround myself with, and the knowledge that I have gained stem from my religion. One of my favorite quotes from the Quran are <a href="https://quran.com/al-baqarah/286">“God does not burden the soul beyond that it can bear”</a>. It’s my favorite as I feel like we all can apply it to our daily lives no matter what struggle we are going through. Stuff I like to do outside of school and religion are working out, reading, watching anime, and hanging out with my friends. This past Summer, I was able to hit 225 lbs on bench which was pretty cool.
